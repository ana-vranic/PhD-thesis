In chapter \ref{Ch:signals}, we discussed how nonlinear growth signal shapes the structure of the complex network. The previous models combined linking rules with constant growth, but we added one more parameter, the fluctuating growth signals, in this research. The most considerable influence is found on scale-free networks. Many interaction networks from social, technological or biological systems have scale-free structures; they are correlated and clustered. These results suggested that it is important to study growing signals' properties. Signals from natural systems show trends and cycles and are characterized by long-range correlations. The structure of the generated complex networks depends on the signal properties. It is necessary to quantify these properties as they affect the network's topology differently. For example, the most significant difference between networks generated with fluctuating and constant signals is found for signals with multi-fractal properties. This difference is more negligible for monofractal signals or uncorrelated white noise. Fluctuating signals promote the creation of hubs in the network and shorten the paths between nodes.

Chapter \ref{Ch:Groups} presented the results of the universal characteristics of the growth of online social groupsâ€”the growth of the system influence the structure of the interaction network. The distribution of the sizes of the complex systems usually follows some universal curve. In many cases, it is lognormal or power-law. The distribution of the dimensions of the city sizes could be explained with Zipf law \cite{gabaix1999}. The citations scales as lognormal distribution \cite{radicchi2008}. In this thesis, we empirically analyzed the growth of online social systems. They consist of groups whose growth is universal. The empirical analyses of Meetup groups and Reddits showed their group size distribution follows universal lognormal distribution, stable over time. This research aimed to examine the structure and dynamics of the interaction network. We proposed the bipartite group model to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that affect the growth of social groups in a complex system. The growth in this model is driven by fluctuating signals, similar to the paper presented in chapter 2: we use a time series of new members from Meetup and Reddit. The number of groups also grows as each user can create a new one; otherwise, the user joins the old group, and different linking rules determine his decision. The lognormal distribution of the group sizes emerges when with probability $p_{aff}$, users prefer groups whose friends are already members, while with probability $1-p_{aff}$, their choice is random. The width of the lognormal distribution depends on the parameter $p_{aff}$. The systems influenced more by social connections have larger $p_{aff}$, and the broader group sizes lognormal distribution.

In chapter \ref{Ch:Trust}, we focused on the Question-Answers platform Stack Exchange. Each site goes through several phases before it is considered successful and so launched. During that period, the site may be closed if there is no strong community. We selected several topics in which sites for the first time were closed, but in the second attempt, they survived and are still active. We provide detailed analysis of active and closed Stack Exchange sites, compare their properties and identify what is crucial for the community's survival. We map user interactions observed in 30 days onto complex networks. Further, we slide the window by one day and follow the evolution of the network. 

According to clustering properties of these networks and discover that sustainable communities have a higher value of local cohesiveness. We use the Bayesian stochastic block modeling approach~\cite{gallagher2020clarified} to determine the core-periphery structure of these networks. We find that sustainable communities develop stable, better-connected cores. To analyze the evolution of collective trust in SE communities, we modify the Dynamic Interaction Based Reputation Model~\cite{melnikov2018toward} (DIBR) model. We use the DIBR model to measure the user's reputation based on the frequency of their activity and its evolution during the first 180 days. The trust between core members of active communities develops early and is higher than in closed communities during the first 180 days. The early emergence of a stable, trustworthy core may be a crucial factor determining a knowledge-sharing community's sustainability.
