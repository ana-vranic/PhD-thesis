% We'll need some colored links, so we load xcolor and hyperref. But
% you can take that out if you don't want links at all.

\usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}

% You can turn off the boxes around links made by hyperref. Then links
% will appear in a different color, and per guidelines, all links must
% be blue or black. For blue links say

\usepackage[colorlinks,allcolors=MidnightBlue]{hyperref} 

% For black links, 
% \usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

% If you prefer hyperref's boxes around links (which don't print), you
% can also change their color. With boxes around links, you probably
% don't want everything in the table of contents to be a link, so we
% only make the page numbers links.

% Often you only want to output a single chapter so you can send it to
% your supervisor. Use includeonly and make sure everything you don't
% always want compiled to PDF is include'd from a separate file. For
% instance, to produce a PDF only of chapter 1, endnotes and
% bibliography, say

% \includeonly{chapter1,backmatter}

% To compile only the title page, which you need when submitting your
% thesis, say

% \includeonly{titlepage}

% and then copy the resulting PDF to a separate file.

\begin{document}

\frontmatter

% titlepage.tex just makes the titlepage; it's in its own file so you
% can typeset it alone using includeonly.

%\include{titlepage}

% frontmatter.tex contains the abstract, preface, acknowledgments, and
% the commands to produce the table of contents, list of tables, etc.

%\include{frontmatter}

% The main matter of the thesis contains the actual content, separated
% into chapters.

\mainmatter

\include{Chapters/Chapter_Introduction}

\include{Chapters/Chapter_DrivingSignal}

\include{Chapters/Chapter_GroupsGrowth}

% The back matter includes commands to produce endnotes, index,
% glossary, bibiliography, and the like.
